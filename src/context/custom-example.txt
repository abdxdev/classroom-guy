enhance this prompt:

i would like general multi-step operations. right now it supports only single step operation. dont repeat types or functions that are used by diff files.
i need to be able to make a system where ai can edit/query data then performs some operations. it should be able to do that in a loop until it gets satisfied. make it so that it makes a plan first depending upon the functions then execute those functions one by one only if ai needs them (you should ask it for continueing the execution with attatching the results from previous query. hope that you understand it)
like here is an example of how the system should work. it is roughly like this. dont worry about the formatting (u will use the structured format). i just want to show you the flow of how it should work. and i want to be able to add more functions in the future. so make it flexible. the functions used in the example are just for demonstration they arent real functions. at each step, the ai should be able to ask for more information if needed. the responces should be stored in a database.
